				time of the Chinese New Year. Marking the end of winter and the beginning of the spring season,
				observances traditionally take place from Chinese New Year's Eve, the evening preceding the first day of
				the year, to the Lantern Festival, held on the 15th day of the year. The first day of Chinese New Year
				begins on the new moon that appears between 21 January and 20 February.

				ethnic Chinese in mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan, Malaysia, Singapore, Cambodia, Indonesia,
				Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam. A celebration of spring, it falls on the first day of the fifth
				solar term (also called Qingming) of the traditional Chinese lunisolar calendar. This makes it the 15th
				day after the Spring Equinox, either 4, 5 or 6 April in a given year. During Qingming, Chinese families
				visit the tombs of their ancestors to clean the gravesites and make ritual offerings to their ancestors.
				Offerings would typically include traditional food dishes and the burning of joss sticks and joss paper.
				The holiday recognizes the traditional reverence of one's ancestors in Chinese culture.

			<p style="padding: 10px;"><span id="name">Dragon dance</span> is a form of traditional
				dance and performance
				in Chinese culture. Like the
				lion dance, it is most often seen during festive celebrations. The dance is performed by a team of
				experienced
				dancers who manipulate a long flexible giant puppet of a dragon using poles positioned at regular
				intervals
				along the length of the dragon. The dragon dance is often performed during Chinese New Year. The Chinese
				dragon(s) is a symbol of China's culture, and they are believed to bring good luck to people, therefore
				the
				longer the dragon is in the dance, the more luck it will bring to the community.

			<p style="padding: 10px;"><span id="name">Lion dance</span> is a form of traditional dance
				in
				Chinese
				culture and other Asian countries
				in which performers mimic a lion's movements in a lion costume to bring good luck and fortune. The
				Chinese
				lion dance is normally operated by two dancers, one of whom manipulates the head while the other forms
				the
				rear end of the lion. The lion dance is usually performed during the Chinese New Year and other
				traditional,
				cultural and religious festivals. It may also be performed at important occasions such as business
				opening
				events, special celebrations or wedding ceremonies, or may be used to honour special guests by the
				Chinese
				communities.
