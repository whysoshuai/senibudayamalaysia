				<h4 style="padding-top: 25px;">Malaysia is a country in Southeast Asia occupying parts of the Malay Peninsula and the island of Borneo.
					It's known for its beaches, rainforests and amazing geographical features such as the Malacca Straits and
					Sarawak Chamber. The capital city, Kuala Lumpur, is home to colonial buildings, busy shopping districts such
					as Bukit Bintang and skyscrapers such as the iconic, 451m-tall Petronas Twin Towers. Malaysia is also the
					melting pot of different cultures and ethics which also makes it a culinary haven.</h4>

				<h2>The origin of the Malays</h2>
				<h4>Malay, any member of an ethnic group of the Malay Peninsula and portions of adjacent islands of Southeast
					Asia, including the east coast of Sumatra, the coast of Borneo, and smaller islands that lie between these
					areas. The Malays speak various dialects belonging to the Austronesian (Malayo-Polynesian) family of
					languages.The Malays were once probably a people of coastal Borneo who expanded into Sumatra and the Malay
					Peninsula as a result of their trading and seafaring way of life. That this expansion occurred only in the
					last 1,500 years or so is indicated by the fact that the languages of the Malay group are all still very much
					alike though very divergent from the languages of other peoples of Sumatra, Borneo, and other neighbouring
					lands. In the early 21st century the Malays constituted about half of the population of Peninsular Malaysia
					(West Malaysia) and about one-eighth of the population of East Malaysia (Sarawak and Sabah).</h4>

				<h2>The origin of the Chinese</h2>
				<h4>Ethnically known as Orang Cina or Kaum Cina in Malaysia, the Malaysian Chinese are the descendants of
					Chinese who arrived between the 14th and mid-20th centuries. The first wave of Chinese emigrants in the 14th
					century were mostly merchants, who were partly attracted to the economic potential of the country and partly
					fleeing from the persecution of the Ching government of Chung Kuok (China). The latter waves were mostly
					poverty-stricken peasants who hoped for a better livelihood for themselves and their families. It was only in
					the 19th century, particularly after the 1820s, that a great number of Chinese migrated to Malaya. Th is was
					due to colonial occupation, which caused rapid economic and land development in the region. This development
					included the opening up of large tracts of land, which created opportunities for mercantile expansion, which
					in turn attracted emigrants from China. Most of these emigrants were from rural villages and small towns of
					the southeastern provinces of Fujian and Gaungdong. Upon arrival in Malaya many worked as indentured laborers
					known as coolies.</h4>

				<h2>The origin of Indians</h2>
				<h4>Indian traders came to Malaya as early as the 14th century. Through trading, they introduced Islam to the
					locals, particularly to the Malays. This was also done by marrying into the various royal families,
					consequently achieving positions of great influence. It was only in the latter half of the 19th century that
					an influx of Indian immigrants came to Malaya, due to its rapid economic development. The largest annual flow
					into Malaya occurred during the period of 1911-30, when more than 90,000 persons landed each year. They were
					recruited and solicited by the British, mostly as indentured laborers to work on rubber plantations. A large
					number of clerical workers were also brought in from Ceylon, while a number of professionals, doctors, and
					teachers were brought in from India, particularly after World War I. Almost every Indian ethnic subgroup is
					represented in Malaysia. This includes the Tamils, Gujaratis, Malayalis, Punjabi, Sindhis, Pathans, Telegus,
					Kannarese, and the Sri Lankan Tamil and Singhalese. They came from many parts of India and belonged to
					different faiths. Nevertheless, Malaysian Indians are mostly Tamils, forming 87.6 per cent of the population
					in Malaysia.</h4>
