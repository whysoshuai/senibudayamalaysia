				final product has a layered texture, a soft interior, and a crispy outer layer. The most common fat used
				in roti canai is ghee, the traditional Indian clarified butter. It is believed that the dish originated
				in India when the Indian laborers who migrated to Malaysia brought the recipe and the tradition of
				preparing this crispy pastry to the foreign country.

				the style of the Mandarin collar.[1] It evolved in the Indian subcontinent in the 19th-century as a

				cape, balaba—being given a western style with a button-down front.
